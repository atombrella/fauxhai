## v6.0.1 (2018-03-07)

- Updated the deprecation warning to now show the date files will be removed as 3/2019 in the Fauxhai 7.0 release.

## v6.0.0 (2018-03-07)

### Removed Deprecated Platforms

All previously deprecated platforms have been removed. If you previously saw deprecation messages when running fauxhai/chefspec you will now see a hard error message linking to the list of supported platforms. This allows us to keep the Fauxhai gem size reasonable and also allows us to remove files that were dumped with very old versions of Chef (10/11).

### New Deprecations

Multiple platform versions are now marked as deprecated and will begin throwing warning messages during ChefSpec runs. This continues the goal of providing only up to date fauxhai dumps using recent builds of Chef. Since regenerating fauxhai data against new releases of Chef involves manually installing each version of distros we're limiting the number of point releases we'll support. This mostly impacts distros such as Debian/RHEL that release many point releases for the same major version.

#### Newly Deprecated Platforms:

- CentOS 5.10 / 6.7 / 7.2.1511
- Debian 7.10 / 8.7 / 8.8 / 9.0 / 9.1
- Fedora 24 / 25
- FreeBSD 11
- openSUSE 13.2 / 42.1
- Oracle 5.10 / 7.2
- RedHat 5.10 / 7.2

### Other Changes

- Added openBSD 6.2 data
- Fauxhai now handles situations where it can fetch new platform data from Github, but can't write it to disk due to lack of permissions. This is pretty common in CI systems like Travis. Previously we'd fail, but no we'll use the data without writing it to disk. This will require fetching it every time, but avoids failures.

  - `Arch`: 4.5.4-1-ARCH, 4.9.11-1-ARCH

- Update the chef/ohai dependencies to allow for Chef/Ohai 13

- Improve the mocked Network data to return more platform appropriate network information.

- Whitelisted additional Ohai plugins to provide better mocked data

  - time
  - shard_seed
  - shells

- Remove backwards compatibility with ChefSpec < 0.9.0 which was released 5 years ago

- Improve error messages when the platform data cannot be fetched remotely

- Fix the logic for enabling / disabling the Github fetching being backwards

## v4.1.0 (2017-03-27)

- Add a new config option "github_fetching" that disables fetching platform mocks from Github

## v4.0.2 (2017-03-20)

- Link to the platforms.md file in the platform not found exception messages

## v4.0.1 (2017-03-09)

- Added a new platforms.md file in this repo that lists all current platforms and versions available. This is generated with a new Rake task
- Updated the error text received when no platform/version is specified to be more clear what fields are missing

## v4.0.0 (2017-03-06)

### New Platform Data

- CentOS 7.3.1611

- Updated CPU attributes and fixed memory to be in kB on Solaris 5.10
- Added node['virtualization']['systems'] = {} to the runner and updated data in existing dumps
- Updated the runner to mock out chef_packages install paths using Omnibus paths not gem install paths and added it to existing dumps.

## v3.1.0

- Added collection of root_group, init_package, and cpu cores to the runner
- Added root_group to existing Linux systems
- Added Fedora 23, openSUSE Leap 42.1, and CentOS 7.2.1511
- Fixed malformed JSON in the Windows 2012 output
- Updated the runner and existing platform files to represent total memory in kB not MB as the default for Ohai has been changed on Windows / Linux
- Added cpu cores to all existing platform files
- Added a Rake task to validate the JSON of all platform files, and enabled Travis to run this task on every PR

## v3.0.1

- Change dependency for Chef and Ohai to a development dependency. The previous dependency on Chef 12 prevented Fauxhai from working with Chefspec on pre-12 Chef releases.

## v3.0.0

- Regenerated json files for all currently supported versions of Ubuntu, CentOS, FreeBSD, Debian, Fedora, and OpenSUSE. This new data is generated with Ohai output from Ohai 8.7.0 in Chef 12.5.1\. This data is more accurate for mocking out current Chef setups, but is changed from the previous Fauxhai 2.3.0 release. If you relied on specific mocked data this may require updating your specs.
